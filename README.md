## Description
        For this homework assignment, we needed to utilize node.js to create a CLI app that would help format, and create a README.md File.
## Installation
        You will need to Clone or download repository, also make sure you have node.js installed. Once you have the files, in your terminal run "npm install" in your terminal to download required dependencies.
 ## Usage
        Run node in your terminal and enter the proper information when prompted. Be mindful that if you have a readme file already open, running this application will rewrite that file.
## Contributors
        
## Test
        Functionality is simple, just run the application in terminal to test it out.
